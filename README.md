## Compilation

Initialize git submodules:

    git submodule update --init
    git submodule foreach --recursive 'if [ $(git config remote.origin.url) = . ]; then git config remote.origin.url "$toplevel"; fi'

We use the Meson build system. On Debian-based distro, it can be
installed by:

    apt install meson

It is recommended, though not necessary, to uses Meson >= 0.52. If
your distribution has an older version, you can install a new one by:

    pip3 install --user meson

Then build everything by running:

    make

### Cross compilation

DEmOS scheduler can be easily cross compiled thanks to [Meson cross
compilation support][cross]. We support cross compilation for 64bit
ARM out of the box:

    sudo apt install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
	make aarch64

The resulting binary `build-aarch64/src/demos-sched` can be copied to
the target ARM system.

## Usage

    Usage: demos-sched -c <CONFIG_FILE> [-h] [-g <CGROUP_NAME>]
      -c <CONFIG_FILE>   path to configuration file
      -C <CONFIG>        in-line configuration in YAML format
      -g <CGROUP_NAME>   name of root cgroups, default "demos"
      -d                 dump config file without execution
      -h                 print this message


Configuration files are written according to [DEmOS specification](./demos-sched.pdf)

## Guide for writing configurations

### Normal form of configuration file

- Define `partitions`. Each partition is defined by `name` and `processes`
- `processes` are defined by command string `cmd` and `budget` in miliseconds
- Define `windows`. Each window is defined by `length` in miliseconds and `slices`
- `slices` are defined by `cpu` string, where it is scheduled, and by safety sritical partition `sc_partition` and best effort partition `be_partition`.
- Format of `cpu` is its number `cpu: 1`, or range `cpu: 0-2`, or combination of both `cpu: 0,2,5-7`
- `xx_partition` is defined by the name reffering to the `partitions`

``` yaml
partitions:
  - name: SC1
    processes:
      - cmd: ./safety_critical_application
        budget: 300
  - name: BE1
    processes:
      - cmd: ./best_effort_application1
        budget: 200
  - name: BE2
    processes:
      - cmd: ./best_effort_application2
        budget: 200
      - cmd: ./best_effort_application3
        budget: 200
        
windows:
  - length: 500
    slices:
      - cpu: 1
        sc_partition: SC1
        be_partitions: BE1
      - cpu: 2,5-7
        be_partitions: BE2
```

### Simplified form of configuration file

- You can ommit `slice` keyword. Then it is expected that there is just one slice inside window scheduled at all cpus.

``` yaml
windows: [ {length: 500, sc_partition: SC} ],
partitions: [ {name: SC, processes: [{cmd: echo, budget:100}] }]
```

is the same as

``` yaml
partitions:
  - name: SC
    processes:
      - cmd: echo
        budget: 300
windows:
  - length: 500
    slices:
      - cpu: 0-7
        sc_partition: SC
```

- You can define partition directly inside `windows` instead of partition name.

``` yaml
windows: [ {length: 500, sc_partition: [{cmd: proc1, budget: 500}] } ]
```

is the same as

``` yaml
partitions:
  - name: anonymous_0
    processes:
      - cmd: proc1
        budget: 500
windows:
  - length: 500
    slices:
      - cpu: 0-7
        sc_partition: anonymous_0
```

- If process `budget` is not set, then the default budget `0.6 * length` of window is set for `sc_partition` processes and `length` of window is set for `be_partition` processes.
- You can use `xx_processes` keyword for definition of partition by the list of commands.

``` yaml
windows: [ {length: 500, sc_processes: [proc1, proc2]} ]
```


### Example configurations

``` yaml
# CPU_switching.yaml
# one process switched between two cpus
#
# all times in ms
# Major frame
windows:
  - length: 500
    slices:
      - cpu: 0
        sc_partition: SC1
  - length: 500
    slices:
      - cpu: 1
        sc_partition: SC1

partitions:
  - name: SC1
    processes:
      - cmd: yes > /dev/null
        budget: 500
```

To verify that `demos-sched` executes the partitions as intended, you
can record and visualise the execution trace with the following
commands:

    trace-cmd record -F -c -e sched_switch build/src/demos-sched -c â€¦
    kernelshark trace.dat

The result will look like in the figure below:
![](./test_config/CPU_switching.png)

``` yaml
# more_partitions.yaml
# two slices with safety critical and best effort tasks within one window

# all times in ms
# Major frame
#period: 100 # not used, do we need this?
windows:
  - length: 1500
    slices:
      - cpu: 0
        sc_partition: SC1
        be_partition: BE1
      - cpu: 1
        sc_partition: SC2

partitions:
  - name: SC1
    processes:
      - cmd: yes > /dev/null
        budget: 500
      - cmd: yes > /dev/null
        budget: 500
  - name: BE1
    processes:
      - cmd: yes > /dev/null
        budget: 500
  - name: SC2
    processes:
      - cmd: yes > /dev/null
        budget: 1000
```

    ```
    src/release_agent.sh
    ```
